# 📘 Linear DSA

Welcome to **Linear DSA** — a personal repository where I consistently solve and upload **3 to 5 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems every day. This practice is aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into subdirectories based on important DSA topics:

- 🔹 `Arrays`
- 🔹 `Searching`
- 🔹 `Sorting`
- 🔹 `Recursion`
- 🔹 `Backtracking`

Each folder contains multiple Java files, each representing a problem and its solution. The filenames are kept meaningful for easier understanding and access.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to:

- Solve 3–5 DSA problems every day
- Organize problems topic-wise
- Track progress consistently
- Build a strong DSA foundation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
